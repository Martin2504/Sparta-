Create a method that will check if a string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a String that is spelled the same forwards and backwards i.e racecar, madam, civic etc. 
The string should be at least 3 characters


!! Extend this by creating a program that finds the longest palindrome in a sentence
- Think about what to do if there are 2 palindromes of equal length
