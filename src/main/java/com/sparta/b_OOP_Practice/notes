OOP 4 Pillars

OOP - programming bases around the concept of objects

A PIE

Abstraction - Hiding implementation details away from the user      (exposing some functionality while hiding how it works, making it easier for the user)

Polymorphism - The ability of a class to run a method in 2 or more different ways

Inheritance - Encourages code re-usability by letting object acquire properties and methods of another object (super class / sub class)

Encapsulation - Built on the idea of data hiding
                   - we restrict access to certain properties or methods of an object to whatever is calling the object
                   - make fields private and generate getters / setters


Class - How we describe a state or behaviour of an object.
