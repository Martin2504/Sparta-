Create a program which abides by the four pillars of OOP.

The implementation can be anything you like. E.g. animals in a zoo.

You must have classes inheriting from other classes. You must have some method calls the exhibit polymorphic behaviour.
Main method should be small and tidy. Classes should be "fully encapsulated" with getters, setters, and properties must be private.

Please test using JUnit, document with a README.md, and upload to GitHub.

Additional task: add abstract classes and interfaces to your program where appropriate.
